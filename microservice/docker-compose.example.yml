  # Example: Your own application that uses the responses service
  # my-app:
  #   build: .
  #   container_name: my-app
  #   ports:
  #     - "8080:8080"
  #   depends_on:
  #     responses-microservice:
  #       condition: service_healthy
  #   environment:
  #     # The service is accessible via the service name
  #     - RESPONSES_SERVICE_URL=http://responses-microservice:3000
  #   networks:
  #     - app-network

  # Example: Backend service (Node.js/Express)
  # backend:
  #   build:
  #     context: ./backend
  #     dockerfile: Dockerfile
  #   container_name: backend
  #   ports:
  #     - "4000:4000"
